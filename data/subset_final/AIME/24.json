  "problem": "For any positive integer $k$, let $f_1(k)$ denote the square of the sum of the digits of $k$.  For $n \\ge 2$, let $f_n(k) = f_1(f_{n - 1}(k))$.  Find $f_{1988}(11)$.",

    "Solution": "We see that $f_{1}(11)=4$\n$f_2(11) = f_1(4)=16$\n$f_3(11) = f_1(16)=49$\n$f_4(11) = f_1(49)=169$\n$f_5(11) = f_1(169)=256$\n$f_6(11) = f_1(256)=169$\nNote that this revolves between the two numbers. Since $1988$ is even, we thus have $f_{1988}(11) = f_{4}(11) = \\boxed{169}$."
