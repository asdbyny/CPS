  "problem": "The complex number $z$ is equal to $9+bi$, where $b$ is a positive real number and $i^{2}=-1$.  Given that the imaginary parts of $z^{2}$ and $z^{3}$ are the same, what is $b$ equal to?",
  "solutions": {
    "Solution": "Squaring, we find that $(9 + bi)^2 = 81 + 18bi - b^2$. Cubing and ignoring the real parts of the result, we find that $(81 + 18bi - b^2)(9 + bi) = \\ldots + (9\\cdot 18 + 81)bi - b^3i$.\nSetting these two equal, we get that $18bi = 243bi - b^3i$, so $b(b^2 - 225) = 0$ and $b = -15, 0, 15$. Since $b > 0$, the solution is $\\boxed{015}$."
