  "problem": "In triangle $ABC,\\,$ angle $C$ is a right angle and the altitude from $C\\,$ meets $\\overline{AB}\\,$ at $D.\\,$  The lengths of the sides of $\\triangle ABC\\,$ are integers, $BD=29^3,\\,$ and $\\cos B=m/n\\,$, where $m\\,$ and $n\\,$ are relatively prime positive integers.

    "Solution 1": "Since $\\triangle ABC \\sim \\triangle CBD$, we have $\\frac{BC}{AB} = \\frac{29^3}{BC} \\Longrightarrow BC^2 = 29^3 AB$. It follows that $29^2 | BC$ and $29 | AB$, so $BC$ and $AB$ are in the form $29^2 x$ and $29 x^2$, respectively, where x is an integer. \nBy the Pythagorean Theorem, we find that $AC^2 + BC^2 = AB^2 \\Longrightarrow (29^2x)^2 + AC^2 = (29 x^2)^2$, so $29x | AC$. Letting $y = AC / 29x$, we obtain after dividing through by $(29x)^2$, $29^2 = x^2 - y^2 = (x-y)(x+y)$. As $x,y \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, the pairs of factors of $29^2$ are $(1,29^2)(29,29)$; clearly $y = \\frac{AC}{29x} \\neq 0$, so $x-y = 1, x+y= 29^2$. Then, $x = \\frac{1+29^2}{2} = 421$.\nThus, $\\cos B = \\frac{BC}{AB} = \\frac{29^2 x}{29x^2} = \\frac{29}{421}$, and $m+n = \\boxed{450}$.",
    "Solution 2": "We will solve for $\\cos B$ using $\\triangle CBD$, which gives us $\\cos B = \\frac{29^3}{BC}$. By the Pythagorean Theorem on $\\triangle CBD$, we have $BC^2 - DC^2 = (BC + DC)(BC - DC) = 29^6$. Trying out factors of $29^6$, we can either guess and check or just guess to find that $BC + DC = 29^4$ and $BC - DC = 29^2$ (The other pairs give answers over 999). Adding these, we have $2BC = 29^4 + 29^2$ and $\\frac{29^3}{BC} = \\frac{2*29^3}{29^2 (29^2 +1)} = \\frac{58}{842} = \\frac{29}{421}$, and our answer is $\\boxed{450}$.",
    "Solution 3": "Using similar right triangles, we identify that $CD = \\sqrt{AD \\cdot BD}$. Let $AD$ be $29 \\cdot k^2$, to avoid too many radicals, getting $CD = k \\cdot 29^2$. Next we know that $AC = \\sqrt{AB \\cdot AD}$ and that $BC = \\sqrt{AB \\cdot BD}$. Applying the logic with the established values of k, we get $AC = 29k \\cdot \\sqrt{29^2 + k^2}$ and $BC = 29^2 \\cdot \\sqrt{29^2 + k^2}$. Next we look to the integer requirement. Since $k$ is both outside and inside square roots, we know it must be an integer to keep all sides as integers. Let $y$ be $\\sqrt{29^2 + k^2}$, thus $29^2 = y^2 - k^2$, and $29^2 = (y + k)(y - k)$. Since $29$ is prime, and $k$ cannot be zero, we find $k = 420$ and $y = 421$ as the smallest integers satisfying this quadratic Diophantine equation. Then, since $cos B$ = $\\frac{29}{\\sqrt{29^2 + k^2}}$. Plugging in we get $cos B = \\frac{29}{421}$, thus our answer is $\\boxed{450}$."
