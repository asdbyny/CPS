  "problem": "The average value of all the pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters in Paula's purse is $20$ cents. If she had one more quarter, the average value would be $21$ cents. How many dimes does she have in her purse?\n$\\text {(A)}\\ 0 \\qquad \\text {(B)}\\ 1 \\qquad \\text {(C)}\\ 2 \\qquad \\text {(D)}\\ 3\\qquad \\text {(E)}\\ 4$",
  "solutions": {
    "Solution 1": "Let the total value, in cents, of the coins Paula has originally be $v$, and the number of coins she has be $n$. Then $\\frac{v}{n}=20\\Longrightarrow v=20n$ and $\\frac{v+25}{n+1}=21$. Substituting yields: $20n+25=21(n+1),$ so $n=4$, $v = 80.$  Then, we see that the only way Paula can satisfy this rule is if she had $3$ quarters and $1$ nickel in her purse. Thus, she has $\\boxed{\\mathrm{(A)}\\ 0}$ dimes.",
    "Solution 2": "If the new coin was worth $20$ cents, adding it would not change the mean. The additional $5$ cents raise the mean by $1$, thus the new number of coins must be $5$. Therefore there were $4$ coins worth a total of $4\\times20=80$ cents. As in the previous solution, we conclude that the only way to get $80$ cents using $4$ coins is $25+25+25+5$. Thus, having three quarters, one nickel, and no dimes $\\boxed{\\mathrm{(A)}\\ 0}.$"
