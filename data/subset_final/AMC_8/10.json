    "Solution": "There are $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{46}{3}\\right\\rfloor =15$ numbers divisible by $3$, $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{46}{5}\\right\\rfloor =9$ numbers divisible by $5$, so at first we have $15+9=24$ numbers that are divisible by $3$ or $5$, except we counted the multiples of $\\text{LCM}(3,5)=15$ twice, once for $3$ and once for $5$.\nThere are $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{46}{15}\\right\\rfloor =3$ numbers divisible by $15$, so there are $24-3=21$ numbers divisible by $3$ or $5$. $\\rightarrow \\boxed{\\text{B}}$"
