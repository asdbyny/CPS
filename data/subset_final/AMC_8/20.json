  "problem": "Suppose there is a special key on a calculator that replaces the number $x$ currently displayed with the number given by the formula $1/(1-x)$.  For example, if the calculator is displaying 2 and the special key is pressed, then the calculator will display -1 since $1/(1-2)=-1$.  Now suppose that the calculator is displaying 5.  After the special key is pressed 100 times in a row, the calculator will display \n$\\text{(A)}\\ -0.25 \\qquad \\text{(B)}\\ 0 \\qquad \\text{(C)}\\ 0.8 \\qquad \\text{(D)}\\ 1.25 \\qquad \\text{(E)}\\ 5$",

    "Solution": "We look for a pattern, hoping this sequence either settles down to one number, or that it forms a cycle that repeats.\nAfter $1$ press, the calculator displays $\\frac{1}{1 - 5} = -\\frac{1}{4}$\nAfter $2$ presses, the calculator displays $\\frac{1}{1 - (-\\frac{1}{4})} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{5}{4}} = \\frac{4}{5}$\nAfter $3$ presses, the calculator displays $\\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{4}{5}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{5}} = 5$\nThus, every three presses, the display will be $5$.  On press $3\\cdot 33 = 99$, the display will be $5$.  One more press will give $-\\frac{1}{4}$, which is answer $\\boxed{A}$."
