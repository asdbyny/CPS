    "Solution 1": "Adding all of the numbers gives us $\\frac{11\\cdot12}{2}=66$ as the current total. Since there are $11$ numbers, the current average is $\\frac{66}{11}=6$. We need to take away a number from the total and then divide the result by $10$ because there will only be $10$ numbers left to give an average of $6.1$. Setting up the equation:\n$\\frac{66-x}{10}=6.1$\n$66 - x = 61$\n$x = 5$\nThus, the answer is $\\boxed{B}$",
    "Solution 2": "Similar to the first solution, the current total is $66$.  Since there are $11$ numbers on the list, taking $1$ number away will leave $10$ numbers.  If those $10$ numbers have an average of $6.1$, then those $10$ numbers must have a sum of $10 \\times 6.1 = 61$.  Thus, the number that was removed must be $66 - 61 = 5$, and the answer is $\\boxed{B}$."
