    "Solution 1": "Let the number in the top circle be $a$ and then $b$, $c$, $d$, $e$, and $f$, going in clockwise order. Then, we have \\[S=a+b+c\\] \\[S=c+d+e\\] \\[S=e+f+a\\]\nAdding these equations together, we get \n\\begin{align*} 3S &= (a+b+c+d+e+f)+(a+c+e) \\\\ &= 75+(a+c+e) \\\\ \\end{align*}\nwhere the last step comes from the fact that since $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, $e$, and $f$ are the numbers $10-15$ in some order, their  is $10+11+12+13+14+15=75$\nThe left hand side is divisible by $3$ and $75$ is divisible by $3$, so $a+c+e$ must be divisible by $3$.  The largest possible value of $a+c+e$ is then $15+14+13=42$, and the corresponding value of $S$ is $\\frac{75+42}{3}=39$, which is choice $\\boxed{\\text{D}}$. \nIt turns out this sum is attainable if you let \\[a=15\\] \\[b=10\\] \\[c=14\\] \\[d=12\\] \\[e=13\\] \\[f=11\\]",
    "Solution 2": "To make the sum the greatest, put the three largest numbers $(13,14$ and $15)$ in the corners. Then, balance the sides by putting the least integer $(10)$ between the greatest sum $(14$ and $15)$. Then put the next least integer $(11)$ between the next greatest sum ($13 +15$). Fill in the last integer $(12)$ and you can see that the sum of any three numbers on a side is (for example) $14 +10 + 15 = 39$\n$\\boxed{\\text{D}}$. "
