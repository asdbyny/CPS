    "Solution": "Find the least common multiple of $15, 20, 25$ by turning the numbers into their prime factorization. \\[15 = 3 * 5, 20 = 2^2 * 5, 25 = 5^2\\] Gather all necessary multiples \n$3, 2^2, 5^2$ when multiplied gets $300$. The multiples of $300 - 300, 600, 900, 1200, 1500, 1800, 2100$. The number of multiples between 1000 and 2000 is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 3}$."
