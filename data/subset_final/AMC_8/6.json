  "problem": "Alex and Felicia each have cats as pets. Alex buys cat food in cylindrical cans that are $6$ cm in diameter and $12$ cm high. Felicia buys cat food in cylindrical cans that are $12$ cm in diameter and $6$ cm high. What is the ratio of the volume of one of Alex's cans to the volume of one of Felicia's cans?\n$\\textbf{(A) }1:4\\qquad\\textbf{(B) }1:2\\qquad\\textbf{(C) }1:1\\qquad\\textbf{(D) }2:1\\qquad\\textbf{(E) }4:1$",
  "solutions": {
    "Solution 1": "Using the formula for the volume of a cylinder, we get Alex, $108\\pi$, and Felicia, $216\\pi$. We can quickly notice that $\\pi$ cancels out on both sides and that Alex's volume is $1/2$ of Felicia's leaving $1/2 = \\boxed{1:2}$ as the answer. ",
    "Solution 2": "Using the formula for the volume of a cylinder, we get that the volume of Alex's can is $3^2\\cdot12\\cdot\\pi$, and that the volume of Felicia's can is $6^2\\cdot6\\cdot\\pi$. Now, we divide the volume of Alex's can by the volume of Felicia's can, so we get $\\frac{1}{2}$, which is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\ 1:2}$.",
    "Solution 3": "The ratio of the numbers is $1/2$. Looking closely at the formula $r^2 * h * \\pi$, we see that the $r * h * \\pi$ will cancel, meaning that the ratio of them will be $\\frac{1(2)}{2(2)}$ = $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\ 1:2}$.",
    "Solution 4": "The second can is $\\cdot 2$ size in each of 2 dimensions, and $\\cdot 1/2$ size in 1 dimension. $2^2/2 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\ 1:2}$.",
    "Solution 5": "Without calculating much, you can do\n($\\pi ra^2) \\cdot ha$ <-- which is Alex's volume, with ra being Alex's radius$(1/2 \\cdot$ diameter), and $ha$ being her cylinders height$(\\pi rf^2) \\cdot hf <--$which is Felicia's volume, with $rf$ being Felicia's radius, and $hf$ being her cylinders height.\nSince we need the ratio between Alexa's and Felicias, we can do $(\\pi ra^2)\\cdot ha/(\\pi rf^2)\\cdot hf$ The $\\pi$ cancel out, then substitute back in the numbers, which gives you:\n$(3^2 \\cdot 12)/(6^2 \\cdot 6) = (9 \\cdot 12)/(36 \\cdot 6) = 18/36 = 1/2 = 1:2$"
