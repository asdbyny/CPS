    "Solution": "Wlog, assume $a_{n}\\ge 3$. Then say $p_{1}, p_{2}, \\ldots, p_{k}\\in \\mathbb{N}$ are all the (pairwise distinct) primes dividing $2^{a_{n}}-3$ and let $a_{n+1}= a_{n}\\cdot \\prod_{i=1}^{k}(p_{i}-1)$. Obviously $p_{i}$ is odd, for any $i \\in \\overline{1,k}$. So $\\prod_{i=1}^{k}p_{i}$ divides $2^{a_{n+1}}-1$, by Fermat's little theorem, and $\\gcd(2^{a_{n+1}}-3, 2^{a_{n}}-3) = 1$. Now, by induction, it follows $\\gcd(2^{a_{m}}-3, 2^{a_{n}}-3) = 1$, for any distinct $m, n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n"
