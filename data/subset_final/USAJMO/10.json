  "problem": "Two permutations $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{2010}$ and\n$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_{2010}$ of the numbers $1, 2, \\ldots, 2010$\nare said to intersect if $a_k = b_k$ for some value of $k$ in the\nrange $1 \\le k\\le 2010$.  Show that there exist $1006$ permutations\nof the numbers $1, 2, \\ldots, 2010$ such that any other such\npermutation is guaranteed to intersect at least one of these $1006$\npermutations.",

    "Solution 1": "Let $n$ be a positive integer. Let $m$ be the smallest positive integer with\n$m > n - m$.  Since $n > n - n = 0$, $m \\le n$. Let $N = \\{1, \\ldots, n\\}$\nbe the set of positive integers from $1$ to $n$.  Let $M \\subset N$,\nbe $M = \\{1, \\ldots, m\\}$.\nLet $P_n$ be the set of of permutations of $N$.\nLet $C_m$ be the set of cyclic permutations of $M$, there are $m$\ncyclic permutations in all, and $C_m$ acts transitively on $M$, i.e.\nfor every pair of elements $a,b \\in M$, there is an element of $C_m$\nthat maps $a$ to $b$.\nLet $C'_m \\subset P_n$ be the permutations in $P_n$ that leave $N\\setminus M$\nfixed, and restricted to $M$ yield one of the permutations in $C_m$.\nThere is a natural one-to-one correspondence between $C'_m$ and $C_m$.\nWe claim that the $m$ permutations $C'_m$ intersect every permutation in\n$P_n$.\nSuppose, to the contrary, that there exists a permutation $p \\in P_n$\nthat does not intersect any permutation in $C'_m$. Since $C'_m$ acts\ntransitively on $M \\subset N$ the permutation $p$ cannot send any element of\n$M$ to any other element of $M$, therefore it must send all the\nelements of $M$ to $N\\setminus M$, but since $N\\setminus M$ has $n - m$ elements and $m > n - m$, this is impossible\nby the pigeonhole principle. Therefore such a permutation cannot\nexist, and the permutations in $C'_m$ intersect every permutation in\n$P_n$.\nFor $n = 2010$ we get $m = 1006$, which is the required special\ncase of the general result above.",
    "Solution 2": "I construct the following permutations by continuously rotating the first 1006 numbers):\n(1, 2, 3 ... 1005, 1006, 1007 ... 2009, 2010)\n(2, 3, 4 ... 1006, 1, 1007 ... 2009, 2010)\n...\n...\n...\n(1006, 1, 2 ... 1005, 1007, ... 2009, 2010)\n\nI claim that these permutations above satisfy the property that any other permutation will intersect with at least one of them.\n:\nAssume for the sake of contradiction that there exists a permutation that won't intersect with these, say $(a_1, a_2, a_3 ... a_{2010})$.\n:\nIf there exists a k such that $1 \\leq k \\leq 1006$ $a_k \\leq 1006$, we will get an intersection with the permutations. \nNote that for any 2 distinct permutations in our list, the numbers in kth index must be different, since each permutation is a rotation of an previous permutation. Also, the numbers can't exceed 1006, so, each number must occur exactly once in the kth index.\n\nUsing the lemma, in order to avoid intersections, we need $1007 \\leq a_k \\leq 2010$, for all $1 \\leq k \\leq 1006$.\nBut, there are 1004 numbers such that $1007 \\leq n \\leq 2010$, but we need to have 1004 numbers to fill in 1006 spots, and thus, by pigeonhole principle(the numbers are the holes, the spots are the pigeons), there must be 2 spots that have the same number! However, in a permutation, all numbers must be distinct, so we have a contradiction.\nSo, we have shown such a set of permutations exists satisfying that any permutation is guaranteed to intersect one of them, and the proof is complete."
