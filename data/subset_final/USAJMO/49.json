    "Solution": "Notice that\n\\[x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + 1 = \\left(x^2 + \\frac{a}{2}x\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{c}{2}x + 1\\right)^2 + \\left(b - \\frac{a^2}{4} - \\frac{c^2}{4}\\right)x^2.\\]\nThus, if $b > \\frac{a^2}{4} + \\frac{c^2}{4},$ then the expression above is strictly greater than $0$ for all $x,$ meaning that $x$ cannot satisfy the equation $x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + 1 = 0.$ It follows that $b\\le\\frac{a^2}{4} + \\frac{c^2}{4}.$\nSince $\\angle ABC\\ge 90^{\\circ},$ we have $b^2\\ge a^2 + c^2.$ From this and the above we have $4b\\le a^2 + c^2\\le b^2,$ so $4b\\le b^2.$ This is true for positive values of $b$ if and only if $b\\ge 4.$ However, since $\\triangle ABC$ is inscribed in a circle of radius $2,$ all of its side lengths must be at most the diameter of the circle, so $b\\le 4.$ It follows that $b=4.$\nWe know that $4b\\le a^2 + c^2\\le b^2.$ Since $4b = b^2 = 16,$ we have $4b = a^2 + c^2 = b^2 = 16.$\nThe equation $x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + 1 = 0$ can be rewritten as $\\left(x^2 + \\frac{a}{2}x\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{c}{2}x + 1\\right)^2 = 0,$ since $b = \\frac{a^2}{4} + \\frac{c^2}{4}.$ This has a real solution if and only if the two separate terms have zeroes in common. The zeroes of $\\left(x^2 + \\frac{a}{2}x\\right)^2$ are $0$ and $-\\frac{a}{2},$ and the zero of $\\left(\\frac{c}{2}x + 1\\right)^2 = 0$ is $-\\frac{2}{c}.$ Clearly we cannot have $0=-\\frac{2}{c},$ so the only other possibility is $-\\frac{a}{2} = -\\frac{2}{c},$ which means that $ac = 4.$\nWe have a system of equations: $ac = 4$ and $a^2 + c^2 = 16.$ Solving this system gives $(a, c) = \\left(\\sqrt{6}+\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}\\right), \\left(\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{6}+\\sqrt{2}\\right).$ Each of these gives solutions for $x$ as $-\\frac{\\sqrt{6}+\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ and $-\\frac{\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}}{2},$ respectively. Now that we know that any valid value of $x$ must be one of these two, we will verify that both of these values of $x$ are valid.\nFirst, consider a right triangle $ABC,$ inscribed in a circle of radius $2,$ with side lengths $a = \\sqrt{6}+\\sqrt{2}, b = 4, c = \\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}.$ This generates the polynomial equation\n\\[x^4 + \\left(\\sqrt{6}+\\sqrt{2}\\right)x^3 + 4x^2 + \\left(\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}\\right)x + 1 = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}}{2}x + 1\\right)^2\\left(\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{6}+\\sqrt{2}}{2}x\\right)^2+1\\right) = 0.\\]\nThis is satisfied by $x=-\\frac{\\sqrt{6}+\\sqrt{2}}{2}.$\nSecond, consider a right triangle $ABC,$ inscribed in a circle of radius $2,$ with side lengths $a = \\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}, b = 4, c = \\sqrt{6}+\\sqrt{2}.$ This generates the polynomial equation\n\\[x^4 + \\left(\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}\\right)x^3 + 4x^2 + \\left(\\sqrt{6}+\\sqrt{2}\\right)x + 1 = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{6}+\\sqrt{2}}{2}x + 1\\right)^2\\left(\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}}{2}x\\right)^2+1\\right) = 0.\\]\nThis is satisfied by $x=-\\frac{\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}}{2}.$\nIt follows that the possible values of $x$ are $-\\frac{\\sqrt{6}+\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ and $-\\frac{\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}}{2}.$\nFun fact: these solutions correspond to a $15$-$75$-$90$ triangle."
