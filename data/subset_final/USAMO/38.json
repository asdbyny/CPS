  "problem": "Find, with proof, the number of positive integers whose base-$n$ representation consists of distinct digits with the property that, except for the leftmost digit, every digit differs by $\\pm 1$ from some digit further to the left.  (Your answer should be an explicit function of $n$ in simplest form.)",

    "Solution": "Let a $k$-good sequence be a sequence of distinct integers $\\{ a_i \\}_{i=1}^k$ such that for all integers $2\\le i \\le k$, $a_i$ differs from some preceding term by $\\pm 1$.\n  Let $a$ be an integer.  Then there are $2^{k-1}$ $k$-good sequences starting on $a$, and furthermore, the terms of each of these sequences constitute a permutation of $k$ consecutive integers.\n We induct on $k$.  For $k=1$, the lemma is trivially true.  Now, suppose the lemma holds for $k$.  If $\\{ a_i \\}_{i=1}^{k+1}$ is a $(k+1)$-good sequence, then $\\{ a_i \\}_{i=1}^k$ is a $k$-good sequence which starts on $a$, so it is a permutation of $k$ consecutive integers, say $m, \\dotsc, M$.  Then the only possibilities for $a_{k+1}$ are $m-1$ and $M+1$; either way, $\\{ a_i \\}_{i=1}^{k+1}$ constitutes a permutation of $k+1$ consecutive integers.  Since there are $2^k$ possible sequences $\\{a_i\\}_{i=1}^k$, and 2 choices of $a_{k+1}$ for each of these sequences, it also follows that there are $2^k \\cdot 2 = 2^{k+1}$ $(k+1)$-good sequences which start on $a$.  Thus the lemma holds by induction.  $\\blacksquare$\nWe now consider the number of desired positive integers with $k$ digits.  Evidently, $k$ must be less than or equal to $n$.  We also note that the digits of such an integer must constitute a $k$-good sequence.  Since the minimum of this sequence can be any of the digits $0, \\dotsc, n-k$, unless the minimum is 0 and is the first digit (in which case the only possible sequence is an increasing arithmetic sequence), and there are $2^{k-1}$ $k$-good sequences up to translation, it follows that there are $(n-k+1) 2^{k-1}-1$ desired positive integers with $k$ digits.  Thus the total number of desired positive integers is\n\\begin{align*} \\sum_{k=1}^n \\bigl[ (n-k+1) 2^{k-1}-1 \\bigr] &= -n + \\sum_{k=1}^n \\sum_{j=k}^n 2^{k-1} = -n + \\sum_{j=1}^n \\sum_{k=1}^j 2^{k-1} \\\\ &= -n + \\sum_{j=1}^n (2^k-1) = - 2n -1 + \\sum_{j=0}^n 2^k, \\end{align*}\nwhich is equal to $2^{n+1} - 2(n+1)$, our answer.  $\\blacksquare$"
