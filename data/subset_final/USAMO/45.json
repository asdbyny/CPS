  "problem": "Let $ABCD$ be a quadrilateral circumscribed about a circle, whose interior and exterior angles are at least 60 degrees. Prove that\n\\[\\frac {1}{3}|AB^3 - AD^3| \\le |BC^3 - CD^3| \\le 3|AB^3 - AD^3|.\\]\nWhen does equality hold?",
  "solutions": {
    "Solution 1": "It suffices to show that \\[|BC^3-CD^3| \\leq 3|AB^3-AD^3|,\\] because the other side of the inequality follows by symmetry. By Pitot's Theorem, we have $AB-AD=BC-CD$. WLOG, let $AB \\geq AD$. Then we have that $BC \\geq CD$, so we must show $BC^3-CD^3 \\leq 3(AB^3-AD^3)$. If $AB=AD$, we are done. Therefore, we will assume for the rest of the proof that $AB>AD$, $BC>CD$.\nThen we would like to show that \\[BC^2+BC\\cdot CD+CD^2 \\leq 3(AB^2+AB\\cdot AD+AD^2).\\]\nBy the Law of Cosines, we have that \\[BD^2=BC^2+k_1(BC\\cdot CD)+CD^2=AB^2+k_2(AB\\cdot AD)+AD^2,\\] where $-1 \\leq k_1, k_2 \\leq 1$ (this is because $60^{\\circ} \\leq \\angle BAD,\\angle BCD \\leq 120^{\\circ}$). Therefore, \\[3(BC^2-BC\\cdot CD+CD^2) \\leq 3(BC^2+k_1(BC\\cdot CD)+CD^2)=3(AB^2+k_2(AB\\cdot AD)+AD^2)\\leq 3(AB^2+AB\\cdot AD+AD^2).\\] Then we wish to show that \\[3(BC^2-BC\\cdot CD+CD^2)-(BC^2+BC\\cdot CD+CD^2) \\geq 0 \\rightarrow 2(BC-CD)^2 \\geq 0,\\] and we are done. $\\blacksquare$",
    "Solution 2": "By a well-known property of tangential quadrilaterals, the sum of the two pairs of opposite sides are equal; hence $a + c = b + d \\Rightarrow a - b = d - c \\Rightarrow |a - b| = |d - c|$ Now we factor the desired expression into $\\frac {|d - c|(c^2 + d^2 + cd)}{3} \\le|a - b|(a^2 + b^2 + ab)\\le 3|d - c|(c^2 + d^2 + cd)$. Temporarily discarding the case where $a = b$ and $c = d$, we can divide through by the $|a - b| = |d - c|$ to get the simplified expression $(c^2 + d^2 + cd)/3\\le a^2 + b^2 + ab\\le 3(c^2 + d^2 + cd)$.\nNow, draw diagonal $BD$. By the law of cosines, $c^2 + d^2 + 2cd\\cos A = BD$. Since each of the interior and exterior angles of the quadrilateral is at least 60 degrees, we have that $A\\in [60^{\\circ},120^{\\circ}]$. Cosine is monotonically decreasing on this interval, so by setting $A$ at the extreme values, we see that $c^2 + d^2 - cd\\le BD^2 \\le c^2 + d^2 + cd$. Applying the law of cosines analogously to $a$ and $b$, we see that $a^2 + b^2 - ab\\le BD^2 \\le a^2 + b^2 + ab$; we hence have $c^2 + d^2 - cd\\le BD^2 \\le a^2 + b^2 + ab$ and $a^2 + b^2 - ab\\le BD^2 \\le c^2 + d^2 + cd$. \nWe wrap up first by considering the second inequality. Because $c^2 + d^2 - cd\\le BD^2 \\le a^2 + b^2 + ab$, $\\text{RHS}\\ge 3(a^2 + b^2 - ab)$. This latter expression is of course greater than or equal to $a^2 + b^2 + ab$ because the inequality can be rearranged to $2(a - b)^2\\ge 0$, which is always true. Multiply the first inequality by $3$ and we see that it is simply the second inequality with the variables swapped; hence by symmetry it is true as well.\nEquality occurs when $a = b$ and $c = d$, or when $ABCD$ is a kite."
